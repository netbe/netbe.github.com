Last week I was in holidays with some friends for a festival and at the end of it, the last day I was already thinking about how I will show them the videos and photos.

I had my iPad mini and in the remaining time between two or three **ploufs**, it was manageable to open iMovie and wrap this up quickly. Everything went fine until the need to add a soundtrack to the movie, I needed a mp3/mp4 file from one of the band of the fest. A quick **youtube to mp3** search and I was almost finish except that it was not possible to save video from Safari or Google Chrome.

Today, searching on the AppStore for a **video downloader** app that could save to the Camera roll, I found out a lot of apps but none properly working.

Hence this post, let's do a small app that download a file from an URL and save it to the Photos app.

Writing a tutorial would be too long, so I'll try my first screencast at the same time, and do it in Swift that way I would end up with some Swift code.
