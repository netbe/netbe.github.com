This year I am happy to start a new job as freelance. After 3 years spent developing iOS apps in a mobile agency, [S2M](https://sinnerschrader-mobile.com/de/), I figured out it was a good time to start working by myself.

And as a first paid job, I am doing Quality Assurance, testing a system around a given API. This gives me the chance to go further on automated tests suite and the same time getting back to `ruby`. I hope learning from that first project and come up with skills to improve my testing of iOS apps.

But I am not done with iOS, I still have some *WIP* apps that I hope *getting done* in the next 3 months.

This new position allows me to be more flexible:

- no restriction on location (ideally: 50% in Berlin, 50% elsewhere)
- learning new skills: finding clients, managing time and finance...
- more open source projects - *ala* [Artsy](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/01/13/OSS-Expectations/)
- share regularly my work and learnings - at least a Blog post per month
