    <h1>Hackathons</h1>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p>Lately, I have been participating to some hackathons in Berlin:</p>

<h2>Apps World Germany</h2>

<p>22/04/2015</p>

<p>This was 2 days event about development, strategy and marketing around mobile and hopefully it included a hackathon -- much more interesting than the conferences. The hackathon had two sponsors :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.the-hackfest.com/events/blukii-hackfest/">Blukii</a>, a company working on sensors based on Bluetooth LE.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.the-hackfest.com/events/wincor-nixdorf-hackfest/">Wincor Nixdorf</a>, offers an Android device including payment system with printer and nfc reader...</li>
</ul>

<p>For that I join one collegue, <a href="https://github.com/Neoklosch">Markus</a> and a former collegue <a href="https://github.com/buffstop">Andreas</a> and formed the <a href="https://github.com/Cookie-Monsters">team Cookie Monster(s)</a> to work on two projects, one for on each sponsor.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Cookie-Monsters/Donator">Donator</a>, an Android app to donate money to charity organisation.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/buffstop/FlowerAlarm">Plantkii</a>, an iOS app to read the humidity, luminosity and temperature of a plant.</li>
</ul>

<p>Technically on the iOS part, I spent to much time on little details like permissions that were not going to show up on the demo. But I did learn a thing or two &#39;cause the SDK to interact with the sensor was in Swift and some methods were not available through the bridge to Objective-C.</p>

<h2>HacknWear</h2>

<p>12/06/2015</p>

<p>Organised by Bemyapp and sponsored by Salesforce, was the occasion to play with some gadgets. On this hackathon with the same team, we end it up doing a Located Question based app called <a href="https://github.com/buffstop/Qute">uQu</a>.</p>

<p>This was better than the Apps World because of the mood, the beer did help ;) but a lot because of the friendly staff and everyone is in the same state, trying to make Salesforce api work.</p>

<p>Besides, I had a chance to play with a Sphero as you can see below. I wouldn&#39;t buy it but it was fun to try it out:</p>

<iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/131478785 " frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

<p>So more about the hack, it was the first/quick attempt to learn about doing an Apple Watch extension, but again wasted time on stuff that did not matter like getting the location and display a map on it and ended up <em>faking it</em>.</p>

<h2>BattleHack Berlin</h2>

<p>19/06/2015</p>

<p>I was not egger to go to that one -- mostly because it was again one (part) of the weekend busy -- but at the end, happy with the result.</p>

<p>We had to include of the sponsors in our hack such as Braintree/Paypal (payment), Heroku, Pusher, Sendgrid and Twilo.</p>

<p>This time I teamed up with Ben and Thomas and we chose to make a Github bot which will help fix issues in giving rewards ($) to contributors.</p>

<p>Though we discovered other people had this <a href="http://bountysource.com">idea</a> or even a team the week before in <a href="https://2015.battlehack.org/tokyo?locale=ja">Japan</a>, I especially like the fact that all the interaction stays on Github and that it does not require permissions on Github. You can call @potogold on any repos and any issues.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/netbe/potogold">Pot o&#39; Gold</a></strong> was not a winning project but was a success for me because we achieved what we wanted in a 24 hours straight (no sleep) and learned new stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li>Github api</li>
<li>Braintree for payment</li>
<li>Flask (similar as Sinatra but in python)</li>
<li>Twilio for sending sms</li>
</ul>

<p>We also used Sendgrid and Heroku but that was not really new to me.</p>

<p>So we will continue this project to make it available (now using sandbox payment) and hopefully the community will support it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>At the end the hackathons are a good experience not only to try something new but as a reminder on what matter during a project : <strong>Get the shit done</strong>. It does not matter if the code is well organised follow convention or documented. Besides most of time you end up faking it for the demo. I hope I get better at it and helps me ship software faster -- what&#39;s the point to have quality without being live?</p>
