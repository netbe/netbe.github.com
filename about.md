I am a French guy working as an iOS developer in Berlin at [Sinnerschrader Mobile](sinnerschrader-mobile.com).

I maintain a tool (open source) to handle translations called [Babelish](github.com/netbe/babelish).

If you want to react about something I wrote you can reach me via [Twitter](twitter.com/netbeatwork), otherwise via [LinkedIn](de.linkedin.com/in/benaiteau).
