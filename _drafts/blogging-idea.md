The other day I watched (again) the movie "The Social Network", and one scene made me thinking.

At one point Zucherberg blogs while coding his hotornothot website. I think it could be a cool idea in order to take a step back on an idea or even just to have a trace of all steps that aimed to the final code.

So, I am going to try to do just that, write short -- or live articles -- that describe my current thought while coding or on a project.

It could be cool to include the updates, for example working on that a markdown file, it would show its related git information ; git commits.
